        This graph analyzes the average age of employees working as data analysts or in related occupations at a variety of different companies. We found that data related positions had far younger employees on average then most other industries, with the average age of a working American falling at about 43 years old, where as the average age of a data analyst falls around 31 years of age.
        
        We looked to measure which cities and metro areas were seeking to fill the most data analyst positions in California with this graph. The four largest cities in California contained the lions share of offered positions within the field, with the metro areas of LA and San Francisco offering a large majority of the positions we discovered during our web scraping and research.
        
        Companies employing data analyst were generally more acceptable than the state standard, with most employeeâ€™s ratings of tech companies within california falling at 3.7 stars, far above the indeed average of around 3 stars.
       
        The salaries offered by companies seemed to have much wider margins of maximum salary consideration with smaller margins for minimum salary considerations, likely because these posting bloat their offered salary to above what they will offer to attract better workers. </p>
